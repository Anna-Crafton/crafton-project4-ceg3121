## Docker How-To:

I downloaded Docker for windows from https://www.docker.com/ and followed the prompts on the installer. Then I did docker --version in powershell to make sure it was installed.

I ran the hello-world container to test Docker, using instructions from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/docker-hello-world/.
I first pulled the hello-world continer with docker pull hello-world, and then ran it with docker run hello-world.

## ??
I navigated to /angular-site/wsu-hw-ng-main and installed angular. 
I already had node js installed on my computer. I tried updating it, which did not work initially because the public wifi network I was using blocked the download somehow. I was able to update it at home using nvm.
